#javascript and classes

1.does js have classes?
technically not their currently too but Yes js does have classes.This feature was introduced in ES6. It is imp to note that JS is prototype based langugae,and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar(just a syntax is given to not feel that js is not having class).It provides this syntax for those programmers who are comming from oop to have a familiar class in Js too

2.OOP
it is a programming paradigm(structure of writing code)

3. Object
   collection of properties(variables,constants) and methods.It is a building block
   Eg:
   toLowerCase-it is an Object
   promises is also an object

4.Why use OOP

5.parts of OOP
