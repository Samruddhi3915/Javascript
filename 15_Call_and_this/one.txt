in call stack we have global execution context,and we have functions in it 

//function call within call which will create execution context for both function and callme,now how to call this for this method-->this keyword will always refer to global execution context(problem of global execution context if window then it refers to window, if node envt it refers to empty object {} )
function()
{
    callMe()
}
