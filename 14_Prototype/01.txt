const newHero=["hulk","spiderman"]
newHero

//JS default behavior is prototypal behavior
(goes layer by layer up till it gets none)
//prototypal inheritance-if prototype under prototype


function->Object(Eg in Object.js file)


Array(newHero)->Object->null
(Object parent->no one therefore referenced as null)


String->Object->null

therefore we can say everything in JS is Object
